<h1>MarkdownJ Quick Start</h1>

<p>This quick start assumes a basic familiarity with Java.</p>

<h2>MarkdownJ as a standalone application</h2>
MarkdownJ can be used from the command line as a simple text2html conversion utility.  The
textfile to be converted is read in on stdin and the resulting html is output to stdout.
<ol>
<li>Make sure your classpath includes markdownj-0.1.0.jar.
<li>Launch MarkdownJ with "<code>java com.petebevin.markdown.MarkdownProcessor &lt; textfile &gt; htmlfile</code>".
</ol>

<h2>MarkdownJ as a library in another Java application</h2>
The primary use of MarkdownJ is as a class library to be invoked in your Java application.
<ol>
<li>Make sure your application classpath includes markdownj-0.1.0.jar.
<li>Use the following sample code to invoke MarkdownJ "<code> m = new MarkdownProcessor(); String html = m.markdown("This is a *simple* test.");</code>".
</ol>
